# 🎙️ Career-Mock Voice based AI Interview Platform

🚀 **A next-generation career mock interview system powered by Artificial Intelligence and Voice Recognition.**

In today’s world, industries and companies are moving toward **AI-driven virtual interviews**.  
To contribute to this real-world transformation, I’ve developed an **AI-Based Voice Interview Platform** — a smart, interactive system designed to simulate real interview experiences for both recruiters and candidates.

## 🌟 Overview

This platform acts as a **career mock AI interview application**, bridging the gap between human interaction and artificial intelligence in recruitment.

It consists of **three main user roles**:

1. 👔 **Recruiter**
2. 🧑‍💼 **Candidate**
3. 🧑‍💻 **Admin**

Each role has distinct functionalities that ensure an efficient and automated interview process.

### 🧑‍💼 Candidate Panel

- **Grok AI** analyzes responses and provides evaluation and scoring for recruiters 🧩  

### 🧑‍💻 Admin Dashboard
- The **Admin** acts as the system supervisor with full control over activities.  
- Monitor all user logins, recruiter credits, and interview data 📈

## 🤖 AI & System Workflow

1. Recruiter creates an interview using **Grok AI** to generate intelligent questions.  
2. The questions are transferred to **VAPI Voice AI**.  
3. Candidate interacts with WAPI during the interview.  
4. WAPI analyzes the candidate’s **voice tone, confidence, and fluency**.  
5. Feedback is generated and sent back to **Grok AI**.  
6. **Grok AI** processes this feedback and updates it on the recruiter’s dashboard.  
7. Recruiter can review the performance and make hiring decisions accordingly.
